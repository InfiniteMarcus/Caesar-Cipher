# Caesar-Cipher

## A simple implementation of Caesar Cipher in C, with a brute force algorithm included

These algorithms were created during the 2020 edition of the UFSCar Sorocaba Hackerspace

It's a test of cryptographic brute force algorithms

You only need to compile and execute the codes to work, using commands like:


```
	gcc caesarCipher.c caesarCipher.h -o caesar
```

And

```
	gcc bruteForce.c caesarCipher.h -o brute
```
