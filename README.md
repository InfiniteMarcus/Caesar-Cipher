# Caesar-Cipher

## A simple implementation of Caesar Cipher in C, with a brute force algorithm included

These algorithms were created during the **2020 edition of the UFSCar Sorocaba Hackerspace**, to test the 
capacity of cryptographic brute force algorithms.

To compile and execute the codes, you can use the following steps:

## Caesar Cipher program:
* Compile: 
	* `gcc main.c caesarCipher.c -o caesar`
	* `make` (if using Make tool)
* Execute: `./caesar`
## Brute Force program:
* Compile: 
	* `gcc bruteForce.c caesarCipher.c -o brute`
	* `make brute` (if using Make tool)
* Execute: `./brute`
