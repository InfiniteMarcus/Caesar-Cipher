# Caesar-Cipher

## A simple implementation of Caesar Cipher in C, with a brute force algorithm included

These algorithms were created during the **2020 edition of the UFSCar Sorocaba Hackerspace**, to test the 
capacity of cryptographic brute force algorithms.

To compile and execute the codes, use the following commands:


```
	gcc main.c caesarCipher.c -o caesar
```

And

```
	gcc bruteForce.c caesarCipher.c -o brute
```
