# Caesar-Cipher

## A simple implementation of Caesar Cipher in C, with a brute force algorithm included

These algorithms were created during the 2020 edition of the UFSCar Sorocaba Hackerspace. It's a test of cryptographic brute force algorithms.

To compile and execute the codes, use the following commands:


```
	gcc caesarCipher.c caesarCipher.h -o caesar
```

And

```
	gcc bruteForce.c caesarCipher.h -o brute
```
